RIDER HAGGARD DEDICATION This faithful but unpretending record of a remarkable adventure is hereby respectfully dedicated by the narrator, ALLAN QUATERMAIN, to all the big and little boys who read it. AUTHOR'S NOTE The author ventures to take this opportunity to thank his readers for the kind reception they have accorded to the successive editions of this tale during the last twelve years. He hopes that in its present form it will fall into the hands of an even wider public,the King Solomon's Mines I dreamed of have been discovered, and are putting out their gold once more, and, according to the latest reports, their diamonds also; the Kukuanas or, rather, the Matabele, have been tamed by the white man's bullets, but still there seem to be many who find pleasure in these simple pages. That they may continue so to do, even to the third and fourth generation, or perhaps longer still, would, I am sure, be the hope of our old and departed friend, Allan Quatermain. H. Rider Haggard. Ditchingham, 1907. INTRODUCTION Now that this book is printed,Also a few pages might have been given up profitably to the consideration of the indigenous flora and fauna of Kukuanaland. 1  Then there remains the most interesting subject - that, as it is, has only been touched on incidentally - of the magnificent system of military organisation in force in that country, which, in my opinion, is much superior to that inaugurated by Chaka in Zululand, inasmuch as it permits of even more rapid mobilisation, and does not necessitate the employment of the pernicious system of enforced celibacy. Lastly, I have scarcely spoken of the domestic and family customs of the Kukuanas,It is a hard thing when one has shot sixty-five lions or more, as I have in the course of my life, that the sixty-sixth should chew your leg like a quid of tobacco. It breaks the routine of the thing, and putting other considerations aside, I am an orderly man and don't like that. This is by the way. Third reason: Because I want my boy Harry, who is over there at the hospital in London studying to become a doctor, to have something to amuse him and keep him out of mischief for a week or so.put one of those chain shirts on to his great shoulders, and took hold of a battle-axe and a horn mug, he might have sat as a model for that picture. And by the way it is a curious thing, and just shows how the blood will out, I discovered afterwards that Sir Henry Curtis, for that was the big man's name, is of Danish blood. 1  He also reminded me\nstrongly of somebody else, but at the time I could not remember who it\nwas.",

So you see I have lived through about seven generations of my class, and I should think that my time cannot be far off, anyway. Now, if anything were to happen to me in the ordinary course of business, by the time my debts are paid there would be nothing left to support my son Harry whilst he was getting in the way of earning a living,which is usually assumed by Zulus on attaining a certain age or dignity.

CHAPTER VI\n\nWATER! WATER! Two hours later, that is, about four o'clock, I woke up,linked together by a precipitous cliff of rock, and towering in awful white solemnity straight into the sky. These mountains placed thus, like the pillars of a gigantic gateway, are shaped after the fashion of a woman's breasts, and at times the mists and shadows beneath them take the form of a recumbent woman, veiled mysteriously in sleep. Their bases swell gently\nfrom the plain, looking at that distance perfectly round and smooth; and upon the top of each is a vast hillock covered with snow, exactly corresponding to the nipple on the female breast.leaving the world nearly dark, for in these latitudes there is but little twilight. So we crept into the cave, which did not appear to be very big, and huddling ourselves together for warmth, swallowed what remained of our brandy - barely a mouthful each - and tried to forget our miseries in sleep. But the cold was too intense to allow us to do so, for I am convinced that at this great altitude the thermometer cannot have marked less than fourteen or fifteen degrees below freezing point. What such a temperature meant to us, enervated as we were by hardship, want of food,",

Rowland took rooms at a villa a trifle nearer Florence, whence in the summer mornings he had five minutes' walk in the sharp, black, shadow-strip projected by winding, flower-topped walls, to join his friends. The life at the Villa Pandolfini, when it had fairly defined itself, was tranquil and monotonous, but it might have borrowed from exquisite circumstance an absorbing charm. If a sensible shadow rested\nupon it, this was because it had an inherent vice; it was feigning a\nrepose which it very scantily felt. Roderick had lost no time in giving the full measure of his uncompromising chagrin,to exhaust her charity for his weaknesses, Roderick would have, as the phrase is, a long row to hoe. She spoke of Roderick as she might have done of a person suffering from a serious malady which demanded much tenderness; but if Rowland had found it possible to accuse her of dishonesty he would have said now that she believed appreciably less than she pretended to in her victim's being an involuntary patient. There are women whose love is care-taking and patronizing, and who rather prefer a weak man because he gives them a comfortable sense of strength.I feel as if I were\nsaying something sinful - I love it! \"\n\n\"If it is sinful, I absolve you,\" said Rowland, \"in so far as I have\npower. We are made, I suppose, both to suffer and to enjoy. As you say,\nit 's a mixture. Just now and here, it seems a peculiarly strange one. But we must take things in turn. \" His words had a singular aptness, for he had hardly uttered them when Roderick came out from the house, evidently in his darkest mood.\"I never have been saner. I don't  want to be bad company, and in this beautiful spot, at this delightful hour, it seems an outrage to break the charm. But I am bidding farewell to Italy, to beauty, to honor, to\nlife! I only want to assure you that I know what I lose. I know it in\nevery pulse of my heart! Here, where these things are all loveliest, I\ntake leave of them. Farewell, farewell! \" During their passage of the Saint Gothard, Roderick absented himself much of the time from the carriage,and so he had to admit\nthat he was indeed faint-hearted. He may perhaps be deemed too narrow a casuist, but we have repeated more than once that he was solidly burdened with a conscience. \"I imagine, \" he said to Roderick, \"that you are not sorry, at present, to have allowed yourself to be dissuaded from making a final rupture with Miss Garland. \" Roderick eyed him with the vague and absent look which had lately become habitual to his face, and repeated \"Dissuaded? \" \"Don't  you remember that, in Rome, you wished to break your engagement,",

He might lay out his money for them; and if they were pictures they might hang on his walls, if they were women a luxury in which he still largely indulged he might dress them richly and buy their smiles and obedience; but possess them never! The flesh-incrusted soul that looked out through the hard blue eyes in their setting of red fat,The flesh-incrusted soul that looked out through the hard blue eyes in their setting of red fat, would know nothing of the possession of that which had beauty. Undine thought as she looked at him how unenviable was the fate of both women and pictures. But she soon forgot him before a large oil painting. It represented a battlefield. Horses and riders, dying and dead, lay around in wild confusion, while in the foreground, stretched out upon a heap of the slain, lay the figure of a man gorgeously clad in the knightly costume of the olden days.",

In the great tree that stood before the door the birds had built their nests and sang there all day long, and the blossoms in the garden had turned to fruit and the tender green leaves had grown dark and strong.

It was a strange reversal in the order of things the honoured wife of the rich man in her velvets and jewels standing out in the night storm and gazing in with envious eyes at the home where poverty and shame had taken their abode.

She went out into it and to the darkness, and in the hut Undine sat with the dead child on her knee.Hitherto her abhorrence of that red-cheeked, scheming affectation had been of a groundless kind, accountable only on the hypothesis of natural antipathies. Other girls as pretty did not arouse the latent feline propensity of her nature in anything like the same degree; it would not have given her half the infinite satisfaction to efface their beauty with thumb and finger nails that she would have had in operating on the cheeks of the scheming affectation.

She was looking radiantly happy, for it is as thrilling as a lover's hot kiss to have fixed on paper something that has looked beautiful to us. \"Are you going to some one? \" asked the woman suddenly. \"Going to some one?",

Four special bulls had been brought over from Spain for the occasion, since Spanish bulls are more fiery than Mexican. Perhaps it is the altitude, perhaps just the spirit of the western Continent which is to blame for the lack of 'pep', as Owen put it, in the native animal. Although Owen, who was a great socialist, disapproved of bull-fights, 'We have never seen one.'Where is the \"Shade\" then? ' said Owen, twisting his neck. At the top of the amphitheatre, near the sky, were concrete boxes. This was the 'Shade', where anybody who was anything sat. 'Oh but,' said Kate, 'I don't  want to be perched right up there, so far away. '\n\n'Why no! ' said Owen. 'We're much better where we are, in our \"Sun\", which isn't  going to shine a great deal after all.

The newspapers had said that the President would attend. But the Presidents are scarce at bull-fights in Mexico, nowadays. There sat the bands, in as much pomp as they could muster, but they did not begin to play. Great crowds now patched the slopes, but there were still bare tracts, especially in the Authorities' section. Only a little distance above Kate's row was a mass of people, as it were impending;it was to see the horse feebly and dazedly walking out of the ring, with a great ball of its own entrails hanging out of its abdomen and swinging reddish against its own legs as it automatically moved. And once more, the shock of amazement almost made her lose consciousness. She heard the confused small applause of amusement from the mob. And that Pole, to whom Owen had introduced her, leaned over and said to her, in horrible English: 'Now, Miss Leslie, you are seeing Life!And that Pole, to whom Owen had introduced her, leaned over and said to her, in horrible English: 'Now, Miss Leslie, you are seeing Life!

A train of geese passed in the glaring sun, automatic, towards the eternal tremble of pale, earth-coloured water beyond the stones.However, in 1921 the hotel was very modestly opened again, with an American manager. Towards the end of the year, José, son of the German-Mexican owner, came to stay with his wife and children in the hotel, in the new wing. José was a bit of a fool, as most foreigners are, after the first generation in Mexico.

Dropping his blanket, he jumped for the cactus cover, and stooping, took the down-slope like a rabbit. The pistol-shots rang out after him, but the Mexicans don't  as a rule take good aim. His bedroom slippers flew off, and barefoot, the man, thin and light, sped down over the stones and the cactus, down to the hotel. When he got down, he found everyone in the hotel awake and shouting. 'They are killing José!What do change and evolution matter? We are the Tree with the fruit forever upon it. And we are faith forever. Verbum sat. The one singer had finished, and only the drum kept on, touching the sensitive membrane of the night subtly and knowingly.

Also a certain repulsiveness. Juana and her children, once they accepted their Niña as their own, were honest with intensity. Point of honour, they were honest to the least little plum in the fruit bowl. And almost intensely eager to serve. Themselves indifferent to their surroundings, they would live in squalor. The earth was the great garbage-bowl.She scuffled off to the market with her pesos, bought endless little things at one or two centavos each, every morning. And every morning there was a reckoning up. Ah! Ah! Where are we? I have no memory. Well then - ah - yes - I bought ocote for three centavos! How much? How much, Niña? How much is it now? It was a game which thrilled Juana to the marrow, reckoning up the centavos to get it just right. If she was a centavo short in the change, she was paralysed. Time after time she would reappear.as she made the tortillas. Tortillas are flat pancakes of maize dough, baked dry on a flat earthenware plate over the fire. And the making consists of clapping a bit of new dough from the palm of one hand to the other, till the tortilla is of the requisite thinness, roundness, and so-called lightness. Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! It was as inevitable as the tick of some spider, the sound of Concha making tortillas in the heat of the morning, peering out of her dark window-hole.Yet again, sometimes she had hot, fierce pangs of maternal protectiveness, when the boy was unjustly treated, as he often was. And if she thought he were ill, a black sort of fatalistic fear came over her. But Kate had to rouse her into getting some simple medicine. Like animals, yet not at all like animals. For animals are complete in their isolation and their insouciance. With them it is not indifference. It is completeness in themselves.

CHAPTER VIII Farmer Blaize was not so astonished at the visit of Richard Feverel as that young gentleman expected him to be. The farmer, seated in his easy-chair in the little low-roofed parlour of an old-fashioned farm-house, with a long clay pipe on the table at his elbow, and a veteran pointer at his feet, had already given audience to three distinguished members of the Feverel blood, who had come separately, according to their accustomed secretiveness, and with one object.",

Something akin to the indications of a change in the spirit of his son, which were now seen, Sir Austin had marked down to be expected,when to hear mention of love is dangerous, and to see it, a communication of the disease. People at Raynham were put on their guard by the baronet, and his reputation for wisdom was severely criticized in consequence of the injunctions he thought fit to issue through butler and housekeeper down to the lower household, for the preservation of his son from any visible symptom of the passion.

I wish, Mr. Chillingly, that I were your\nsister, and that you would confide in me. Something troubles you. \"\n\n\"Troubles me, - no. My thoughts are happy ones, and they may sometimes\nperplex me, but they do not trouble. \"\n\nKenelm said this very softly; and in the warmer light of his musing eyes, the sweeter play of his tranquil smile, there was an expression which did not belie his words.\"And so you are happy, Will? \" said Kenelm, seating himself between the\nbasket-maker and the infant; the dear old mother beside him, reading the tract which linked her dreams of life eternal with life just opening in the cradle that she rocked.

She bestowed upon Kenelm a liking somewhat more warm,\nand mingled with compassion. His eccentricities would have puzzled her, if she had allowed herself to be puzzled: it troubled her less to pity them. She did not share her husband's desire for his union with Cecilia. She thought that her son would have a higher place in the county if he married Lady Jane, the Duke of Clanville's daughter; and \"that is what\nhe ought to do,\" said Lady Chillingly to herself.and \"that is what\nhe ought to do,\" said Lady Chillingly to herself. She entertained none of the fear that had induced Sir Peter to extract from Kenelm the promise not to pledge his hand before he had received his father's consent. That the son of Lady Chillingly should make a mesalliance , however crotchety he might be in other respects, was a thought that it would have so disturbed her to admit that she did not admit it. Such was the condition of things at Exmundham when the lengthy communication of Kenelm reached Sir Peter's hands.

On the very day on which Kenelm arrived at Exmundham, Chillingly Gordon had received this letter from Mr. Gerald Danvers. DEAR GORDON, - In the ministerial changes announced as rumour in the public papers, and which you may accept as certain, that sweet little cherub - is to be sent to sit up aloft and pray there for the life of poor Jack; namely, of the government he leaves below. In accepting the peerage, which I persuaded him to do,whispering, \"That man has so disappointed me: he is so unworthy of the happiness I had once hoped for him! \"\n\n\"Whom do you speak of? \" murmured Cecilia, turning very pale. \"Kenelm Chillingly. It seems that he has conceived a fancy for some penniless girl whom he has met in his wanderings, has come here to get the consent of his parents to propose to her, has obtained their consent, and is gone to propose. \" Cecilia remained silent for a moment with her eyes closed, then she said, \"He is worthy of all happiness,if a single acute suffering endured by a fellow mortal could be brought before the evidence of his senses, I doubt whether he would not have suffered as much as that fellow-mortal. So that, though if there were a thing in the world which Kenelm Chillingly would care not to do, it was verse-making, his mind involuntarily hastened to the arguments by which he could best mitigate the pang of the verse-maker. Quoth he: \"According to my very scanty reading, you share the love of verse-making with men the most illustrious in careers which have achieved the goal of fame.",
