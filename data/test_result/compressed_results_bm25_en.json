Ditchingham,\n 11 March, 1898. POST SCRIPTUM Now, in 1907, on the occasion of the issue of this edition, I can only add how glad I am that my romance should continue to please so many readers. Imagination has been verified by fact; the King Solomon's Mines I dreamed of have been discovered,the King Solomon's Mines I dreamed of have been discovered, and are putting out their gold once more, and, according to the latest reports, their diamonds also; the Kukuanas or, rather, the Matabele, have been tamed by the white man's bullets, but still there seem to be many who find pleasure in these simple pages. That they may continue so to do, even to the third and fourth generation, or perhaps longer still, would, I am sure, be the hope of our old and departed friend, Allan Quatermain. H. Rider Haggard. Ditchingham, 1907. INTRODUCTION Now that this book is printed,Turned out by my\nLords of the Admiralty to starve on half pay. And now perhaps, sir, you\nwill tell us what you know or have heard of the gentleman called\nNeville. \"\n\n\n 1  Mr. Quatermain's ideas about ancient Danes seem to be rather\nconfused; we have always understood that they were dark-haired people. Probably he was thinking of Saxons. - Editor.

To the left\nlay the vast desert. This spot appears to be the outpost of the fertile country, and it would be difficult to say to what natural causes such an abrupt change in the character of the soil is due. But so it is. Just below our encampment flowed a little stream, on the farther side of which is a stony slope, the same down which, twenty years before, I had seen poor Silvestre creeping back after his attempt to reach Solomon's Mines, and beyond that slope begins the waterless desert,we gazed across the desert. The air was very clear, and far, far away I could distinguish the faint blue outlines, here and there capped with white, of the Suliman Berg. \"There,\" I said, \"there is the wall round Solomon's Mines, but God\nknows if we shall ever climb it. \" \"My brother should be there, and if he is, I shall reach him somehow, \" said Sir Henry, in that tone of quiet confidence which marked the man.At\nthe worst he can but die a little sooner. I will go with thee across the desert and over the mountains, unless perchance I fall to the ground on the way, my father. \" He paused awhile, and then went on with one of those strange bursts of rhetorical eloquence that Zulus sometimes indulge in, which to my mind, full though they are of vain repetitions, show that the race is by no means devoid of poetic instinct and of intellectual power. \"What is life?",

So we crept into the cave, which did not appear to be very big, and huddling ourselves together for warmth, swallowed what remained of our brandy - barely a mouthful each - and tried to forget our miseries in sleep. But the cold was too intense to allow us to do so, for I am convinced that at this great altitude the thermometer cannot have marked less than fourteen or fifteen degrees below freezing point.

Although Owen, who was a great socialist, disapproved of bull-fights, 'We have never seen one.They want to foster lies and crime. What they call liberty here is just freedom to commit crime.

He had married young; not from any ardent inclination for the connubial state, but in compliance with the request of his parents. They took the pains to select his bride; and if they might have chosen better, they might have chosen worse, which is more than can be said for many men who choose wives for themselves.CHAPTER V.\n\nBEFORE his relations dispersed, Sir Peter summoned Mr. Gordon into his\nlibrary. \"Cousin, \" said he, kindly, \"I do not blame you for the want of family affection, or even of humane interest, which you exhibit towards the New-born. \"\n\n\"Blame me, Cousin Peter! I should think not. I exhibit as much family affection and humane interest as could be expected from me, - circumstances considered. \" \"I own, \" said Sir Peter, with all his wonted mildness, \"that after remaining childless for fourteen years of wedded life,Lord Hautfort denies my right of free\nwarren over a trout-stream that runs through his lands. I don't  care a\nrush about the trout-stream, but there is no doubt of my right to fish\nin it. He was an ass to raise the question; for, if he had not, I\nshould not have exercised the right. As he did raise the question, I was\nobliged to catch his trout. \"\n\n\"And you wrote a letter to him? \"\n\n\"Yes. \"\n\n\"How did you write, Papa?
