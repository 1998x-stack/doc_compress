His name was Evans, and he was killed the following year, poor fellow, by a wounded buffalo, and lies buried near the Zambesi Falls. I was telling Evans one night, I remember,but\nthis is by the way. At last, one beautiful evening in January, which is our hottest month, we steamed past the coast of Natal, expecting to make Durban Point by sunset. It is a lovely coast all along from East London, with its red sandhills and wide sweeps of vivid green, dotted here and there with Kafir kraals, and bordered by a ribbon of white surf, which spouts up in pillars of foam where it hits the rocks.

Undine, as soon as she was dressed, ran down to the beach; there the tiny waves danced laughing on the sides of the big ones, which in their turn chased and overtook one another, tossing their heads high into the sunny air and turning to white foam,What a pity she should think so much of\n\ndress at her age; and oh, the adornments of the outer man, what are they, my dear Miss Mell, what are they? \"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Miss Mell, \"yes, indeed. \"\n\n\"And her poor husband, my dear,\" continued Mrs. Goodman, \"he can't  stand it, my dear, he can't  stand it. Did you notice the really\nsu\nperb silk she had on really\nsu\nperb. \"\n\n\"I don't  think it was silk;she also rose quickly and, standing in the doorway, said, \"Grandfather. \"\nHe turned round slowly and fixed his cold eyes on her. \"What is the matter? \" he asked. Seek of the dumb an answer, and you will as easily find it as Undine the words of her precious and laboriously concocted little speech. They had hopelessly vanished and gone, and in their place came only these \"I am not going to chapel. \" \"I thought I had given you clearly to understand, Undine, on a previous occasion, that I wished you always to go.Would she have to walk on alone, alone, unloved, misunderstood, right on to the end? She was sobbing and digging away with her toes into the soft earth when Aunt Margaret came and kneeled down beside her. \"Go away,\" said Undine, fiercely. \"I am alone. Leave\nme alone. \"\n\n\"Undine darling, what have I done to you? What has anyone done to you? Undine, you say you love Christ and are trying to be his child. Don't  you think you were wrong to speak as you did just now?It is what I deserve, it is God's punishment on me for loving a man who mocked His name, who had no faith in Christ; but, Undine, Undine, heaven will be no heaven to me if he is not there. I would give my soul so willingly to reclaim his; I could bear all for him. Pray, Undine, pray. I cannot. \" And Undine prayed prayed as we pray for that which we are losing, for that for which we fear the day of prayer has almost ended. \"Talk, Undine, talk,\" said Aunt Margaret.",

So Undine walked beside her companion, with his black-blue woman's eyes and his soft voice, feeling a kindly contempt for him, in spite of his infinite superiority to herself in knowledge and acquirements of every kind. \"What do you think of them? \" said Cousin Jonathan, when after a somewhat lengthy call their visitors had taken their departure. \"Nothing,\" said Undine.One of these latter was Albert Blair. Everyone on whom the cold beam fell felt awkward, ill-dressed, and ignorant. Elegant dandies felt in his presence that their whiskers were too long, the set of their coats execrable, and their way of handling a cane simply clownish and disgraceful. Ladies, however well contented they had been with their own appearance the moment before, discovered that their dress was all in shocking taste, their knuckles were too large and their sleeves too short, when the blue eyes were turned upon them.\" \"I care nothing about it unless you give it me, \" he answered, in a deep passionate voice that always angered her. \"There, \" she said, pulling out a great gaudy dandelion, which in spite of his disapproval she had persisted in putting in the bunch. \"How long the shades are growing. I really must go and get tea ready. I'm very discourteous to dismiss you in this way, am I not? \" said his angel, and with a laugh fluttered out at the back door. \"What a poor fool I am!\"You are leaving for London tomorrow, are you not? \" he asked his father, who sat on the opposite side of the fire. \"Yes,\" was the short rejoinder. \"Be back at the beginning of summer? \"\n\"Perhaps so. Depends on circumstances. \"\n\"When are you taking yourself off? \"\n\"Don't  know. \" The master of the dog had more than one attraction in Greenwood, and a lady who must be kept in hand close by; so, though the place was wretchedly dull, he was in no hurry to leave it.",

Master and dog made a pretty picture as they stood on a raised bank, with the leaden sky and leafless trees for a background. Both looked so strong and placid, so perfect after their types. The half-closed eyes caught sight of her in a moment, and their owner came forward to meet her.What is your idea of what a woman ought to be? \" \"You are asking me a question hard to answer, \" he replied, looking with his half-closed eyes into the fire. \"A woman to be womanly should have nothing striking or peculiar about her; she should\n\nshun all extremes in manners and modes of expression; she should have no strong views on any question, especially when they differ from those of her surroundings; she should not be too reserved in her manners, and still less too affable and undignified.and the little Dutch girls, and the old red farmhouse in the Karoo saw the little round-stone koppies, with their milk bushes and red sand, and was again the little child among them all, with the child's thoughts and longings. Albert Blair sat and listened without the shade of a sneer upon his lips. Most men have their moments of insanity, which belie and are at variance with all the days and years of the past and will find no successor in the future, moments when their thoughts and feelings are opposed to all they have ever deemed rational, right or possible.But, she resolved, I will be all he wishes me; he shall be proud of me, prouder than of all his dogs and horses, she thought, as she clenched and loosened the fingers of her little gloveless hand. \"What causes you always to move your hand in that extraordinary manner whenever you are angry? It is not very pretty, I can assure you. \"\n\"I am not angry; I was only thinking. \"\n\"What? \"\n\"That I will try and be everything you wish. Do you believe me?\"Be sure you practise this evening; you are my own little darling,\" he said, and pressed a long kiss on her lips. \"Don't  sit up too late, and look as pretty and as sweet when I come tomorrow as you do now.

Undine had sat below them, working a little, dozing a little, all day. She was glad the blossoms were gone, for their smell made her heart heavy. \"Lor'!In the hearth the smouldering fire was almost extinguished by the rain which came down through the chimney, and the drops which made their way through the roof gathered themselves together in pools on the uneven floor.

Four special bulls had been brought over from Spain for the occasion, since Spanish bulls are more fiery than Mexican. Perhaps it is the altitude, perhaps just the spirit of the western Continent which is to blame for the lack of 'pep', as Owen put it, in the native animal. Although Owen, who was a great socialist, disapproved of bull-fights, 'We have never seen one.It is like Italy as I always knew it, decent, and with a bit of human generosity. I do think Mexico City is evil, underneath. '\n\n'Well,' he said, 'the hotels are bad. It is unfortunate, but the foreigners seem to make the Mexicans worse than they are naturally. And Mexico, or something in it, certainly makes the foreigners worse than they are at home. '\n\nHe spoke with a certain bitterness. 'Perhaps we should all stay away,' she said. 'Perhaps! ' he said, lifting his shoulders a little.' said Owen vaguely. 'Exactly. But still there was some very skilful work, very pretty. Really very plucky. '\n\n'Yah! ' snarled Kate. 'Plucky! They with all their knives and their spears and cloaks and darts - and they know just how a bull will behave. It's just a performance of human beings torturing animals, with those common fellows showing off, how smart they are at hurting a bull. Dirty little boys maiming flies - that's what they are. Only grown-up, they are bastards, not boys.'Yes, it is true you must not touch the one who is hurt. '\n\n'How disgusting! ' said Kate. 'Disgusting! ' cried the Judge. 'A great deal is disgusting in this country, as you'll learn if you stay here long. I nearly lost my life on a banana skin; lay in a darkened room for days, between life and death, and lame for life from it. '\n\n'How awful! ' said Kate. 'What did you do when you fell? '\n\n'What did I do? Just smashed my hip.I know there is. '\n\nThe Judge was silent from exasperation for a few moments, then he snapped:\n\n'Jade's bright green. '\n\nOwen, who had the ears of a lynx, had heard. 'What's that? ' he said. 'Surely there's more than green jade! ' said Kate. 'What! ' cried Owen. 'More! Why there's every imaginable tint - white, rose, lavender - '\n\n'And black? ' said Kate. 'Black? Oh yes, quite common. Why you should see my collection. The most beautiful range of colour! Only green jade! Ha-ha-ha!",

He had married young; not from any ardent inclination for the connubial state, but in compliance with the request of his parents. They took the pains to select his bride; and if they might have chosen better, they might have chosen worse, which is more than can be said for many men who choose wives for themselves.For this reason I have\nordered the family pedigree to be suspended on yonder wall.

He was an\nearly riser, and accustomed to solitary rambles before his parents were\nout of bed.
